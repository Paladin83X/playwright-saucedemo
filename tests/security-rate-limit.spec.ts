/**
 * This test is designed to verify the application's security against brute-force login attacks.
 * It simulates a series of rapid, failed login attempts for an existing user ('standard_user')
 * with an incorrect password.
 *
 * The purpose is to check if the application implements a **rate-limiting or lockout mechanism**.
 * 
 * The 'delayMs' parameter is set to a realistic value for automated bots (400-800ms),
 * aiming to bypass simple protections.
